# Titanic_Survival_Prediction_Using_Logistic_Regression
In this project i have used logistic regression to predict the survival of titanic.

Project Description:
In this particular project, we are using a dataset that contains information like, Passengerid, Survived,pclass, sex, Age, sibsp, parch, ticket, fare, cabin, embarked.
and using that data we are going to predict the survived passengers. 
However, before you go ahead and make a prediction, it is advised that you first pre-process the data, since it may contain some irregularities and noise.
In addition, try various tricks and techniques in order to gain the best accuracy in your predictions.
